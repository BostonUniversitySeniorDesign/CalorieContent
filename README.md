# calorie_app

This project was the introductory mini project for Computer Engineering students enrolled in the Senior Design (i.e Senior Capstone) session I class.
The purpose of this project is to act as a refresher/introduction to cross-platform/Full-Stack app development using Agile methodologies. 
It is also meant as an introduction to the style of the course, and get students accustomed to working in pairs.

The introduction of the Software Mini Project is the following: to create a mobile app that tracks the calories of foods/recipes that you eat and stores them. 
It calculates the calorie content through scanning product barcodes and using a USDA/FDA RESTful API.
 
While this project is not graded to completetion, here are the expected requirements:
#### Backend service
1. REST Service to return calories of a recipe based on
2. Barcodes of ingredients, images of ingredients, and/or name of ingredient
3. Servings per item in the call
#### Application will calculate calories of a recipe or food you eat
4. Take a picture
5. Read barcodes of products
6. Ask the user for amount of servings
7. Keeps track of all users recipes and daily food intake
8. Use Gmail for authentication
#### Use FDA API to get nutrition information to get nutrition facts
* Study them well
* Build test examples
